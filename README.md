# Au Org Ontology
An OWL ontology specialising the [Organization Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) to model Australian government entities.

The purpose of this ontology is to allow for the Semantic Web representation of Australian Government, mostly Federal Government, Entities (organisations), their subcomponents and people related to them with particular roles.

This ontology specialises the W3C's recommended Organization Ontology to model Entities. Its specialised classes and properties have been initially informed by the Australian government's online organisations directory, <https://www.directory.gov.au>. This includes particular types of organisation found in Australian Federal government such as a 'Board', 'Government Entity' and so on. While it has been designed primarily with the Commonwealth Government in mind, it is intended that it shall also apply at other levels of government.

Further specialisation and extension is likely as this ontology is developed to cover the conceptual space of systems that are important for Australian government structure, such as the Administrative Arrangement Orders that alter Entities.

This ontology is incomplete and is currently for demonstration purposes only.

While under early development, HTML documentation of this ontology can be viewed at: <https://rawgit.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/auorg-ont/master/auorg.html>, but note that where they differ, the RDF representation is correct.
