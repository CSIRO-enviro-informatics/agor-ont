# Au Org Ontology
An OWL ontology specialising the [Organization Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) to model Australian Federal government entities.

The purpose of this ontology is to allow for the Semantic Web representation of Australian Federal Government Entities (organisations), their subcomponents and people related to them with particular roles.

This ontology specialises the W3C's recommended Organization Ontology to model Entities. Its specialised classes and properties have been initially informed by the Australian government's online organisations directory, https://www.directory.gov.au. This includes particular types of organisation found in Australian Federal government such as a 'Board', 'Government Entity' and so on.

Further specialisation and extension is likely as this ontology is developed to cover the conceptual space of systems that are important for Australian government structure, such as the Administrative Arrangement Orders that alter Entities.

This ontology is incomplete as of v0.6 and is currently for demo purposes only.
